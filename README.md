This is a basic Snake game implemented with Pygame in Python. In this game, the snake plays as a moving figure around the screen to eat apples or oranges to prevent itself from colliding with its self.
At the start of the game, this little snake keeps growing while the snake continues to take apples. Key Features:

Movement : The snake goes on its way constantly in one of four directions - up, down, left or right - by using the arrow keys.
Boundaries: It disappears from one edge of the screen and can be seen reappearing at the opposite edge.
Food/Apples: Apples appear at random across the screen. If the snake eats an apple, the length is increased by a segment, while the points also added are for the apples the snake would consume.
GameOver: If a snake hits itself then the game ends with the appearance of a "Game Over" screen.
Score Board: The number of apples eaten appears at the top right-hand side according to the score reached by the player.
Clock Timer: At the upper-left hand side, a clock timer is there to show how long the game has been in play.
Difficulty: Frame rate has been set at 25 FPS so that the snake moves as smoothly and responsively as possible.
Gameplay: In this game, you have to grow the snake as long as you could without hitting its own body. For a game over, you have an option to restart the game or to simply quit it.
